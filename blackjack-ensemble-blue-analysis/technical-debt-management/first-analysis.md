## Technical Debt Categories

### 1. Architectural Debt (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### **Hexagonal Architecture Migration (In Progress)**
- **Description:** The codebase is transitioning from a traditional layered architecture to hexagonal architecture
- **Evidence:** Recent commits show movement of files to `application/` and `application/port/` packages
- **Impact:** Temporary architecture inconsistency during migration
- **Files Affected:** 
  - `GameService.java` (moved to application layer)
  - `GameMonitor.java` (moved to application.port)
  - Various adapter classes

**Remediation Strategy:**
- Complete the hexagonal architecture migration
- Establish clear dependency rules using ArchUnit
- Document architectural decision records (ADRs)

#### **Dependency Injection Inconsistencies**
- **Description:** Mixed patterns for dependency injection in web controllers
- **Evidence:** `BlackjackController.java` shows evolution of constructor injection patterns
- **Files Affected:** Web adapter layer components

**Code Example:**
```java
// Current inconsistent pattern in BlackjackController
@Autowired
public BlackjackController(GameService gameService, PlayerAccountFinder playerAccountFinder) {
    this.gameService = gameService;
    this.playerAccountFinder = playerAccountFinder;
}

// Previous iterations showed direct instantiation
// playerAccountFinder = new PlayerAccountRepository();
```

### 2. Design Debt (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### **High Churn in Web Controllers**
- **Description:** `BlackjackController.java` has extremely high commit frequency (102+ modifications)
- **Root Cause:** Frequent changes indicate design instability or lack of abstraction
- **Pattern:** Many commits show small incremental changes suggesting reactive development

**Commit Analysis:**
- Frequent dependency injection changes
- Multiple feature flag implementations
- Repeated refactoring of the same methods
- Method signature changes across commits

**Remediation Strategy:**
- Extract stable interfaces for web layer interactions
- Implement command pattern for user actions
- Create view model builders to reduce controller complexity

#### **Feature Flag Technical Debt**
- **Description:** Evidence of feature flags used for betting functionality
- **Evidence:** Comments like "feature flag" and conditional logic in controllers
- **Risk:** Accumulated complexity from multiple feature toggles

**Code Example:**
```java
// Evidence from commit history
if (useNewPlayerBet) {
    // new implementation
} else {
    // old implementation  
}
```

### 3. Code Quality Debt (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### **Mob Programming Artifacts**
- **Description:** Frequent "mob next" commits indicate collaborative development
- **Impact:** 
  - Many small, incremental commits
  - Potential for incomplete feature implementations
  - Code quality inconsistencies between sessions

**Commit Pattern Example:**
```
mob next [ci-skip] [ci skip] [skip ci] - Multiple contributors
Ensemble #150: started using Result, then put additional work on hold
```

#### **Comment-Driven Development**
- **Description:** Many commits show TODO comments and incomplete implementations
- **Evidence:** Comments like "Do we need / are allowed to access PlayerAccountRepository here?"
- **Risk:** Accumulated incomplete work and unclear intentions

### 4. Test Debt (LOW PRIORITY)

#### **Test Builder Pattern Implementation**
- **Description:** The codebase shows active work on implementing test data builders
- **Evidence:** Recent commits mention "Test Data Builders for more convenient and readable tests"
- **Status:** Work in progress - positive direction

#### **Test Organization**
- **Description:** Test files are well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- **Evidence:** Separate test configurations for unit vs integration tests
- **Strength:** Good testing practices in place

## Domain Model Analysis

### Strengths:
1. **Rich Domain Model:** 42 domain files indicating complex business logic
2. **Event Sourcing:** `EventSourcedAggregate.java` and event-based patterns
3. **Domain-Driven Design:** Clear separation of domain concepts
4. **Comprehensive Exception Handling:** Custom domain exceptions for business rules

### Technical Debt in Domain:
1. **Player Management Complexity:** Multiple player-related classes suggest design complexity
2. **Game State Management:** Multiple state-related exception classes indicate complex state machine

---

## Infrastructure and Build Debt

### Recent Improvements:
- **Java Version:** Recently upgraded to Java 24 (shows maintenance attention)
- **Spring Boot:** Up-to-date version 3.4.4
- **ArchUnit:** Version 1.4.0 for architecture testing

### Potential Issues:
- **Preview Features:** Usage of `--enable-preview` suggests experimental Java features
- **Build Complexity:** Multiple Maven plugins for different purposes
